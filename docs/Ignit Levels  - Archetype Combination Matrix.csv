Stabilizer,Just Stabilizer: Smooth a very unstable source for one sensitive target.,"Stabilize, then Split: Filter an unstable source, then distribute the stable power to multiple targets.","Stabilize for a Clean Charge: Filter a noisy source to ensure a precise, timed energy pulse to a capacitor.",Protect from Unstable Surge: Smooth a source that is both unstable and overpowered.,"Stable Logic: Power a logic circuit, but the main power source is unstable, risking incorrect states."
Splitter,"Stabilize, then Split: Filter an unstable source, then distribute the stable power to multiple targets.",Just Splitter: Precisely divide power among 3+ targets with very different energy needs.,Split Charge: Charge multiple capacitors to different levels simultaneously from a single source.,"Protect One, Power Others: One branch must be protected from over-power while other branches are powered correctly.","Conditional Splitting: Power is split to multiple targets, but some branches are activated via logic gates."
Timed Charge,"Stabilize for a Clean Charge: Filter a noisy source to ensure a precise, timed energy pulse to a capacitor.",Split Charge: Charge multiple capacitors to different levels simultaneously from a single source.,"Just Timed Charge: A complex sequence of timed events (e.g., ""Charge A, then discharge it to power B"").",Efficient High-Power Charge: Charge a target in time while safely shunting a massive excess of energy.,Logically Triggered Charge: The charging process can only be initiated when a specific logical condition is met.
Protector,Protect from Unstable Surge: Smooth a source that is both unstable and overpowered.,"Protect One, Power Others: One branch must be protected from over-power while other branches are powered correctly.",Efficient High-Power Charge: Charge a target in time while safely shunting a massive excess of energy.,Just Protector: The source is massively overpowered. The goal is to divert energy with maximum efficiency.,Conditional Safety: The protection circuit must only engage when a certain switch is flipped.
Logic Gate,"Stable Logic: Power a logic circuit, but the main power source is unstable, risking incorrect states.","Conditional Splitting: Power is split to multiple targets, but some branches are activated via logic gates.",Logically Triggered Charge: The charging process can only be initiated when a specific logical condition is met.,Conditional Safety: The protection circuit must only engage when a certain switch is flipped.,Just Logic Gate: Build a complex boolean expression using switches to power a target.
