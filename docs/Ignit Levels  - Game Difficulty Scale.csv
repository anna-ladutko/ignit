1,Tutorial,"""My first time with this mechanic.""",Simple series circuit (Source -> Resistor -> Target).,1,Very Wide (+/- 20%),0. The kit contains only the required components.,None.
2,Basic,"""I understand the basics and can apply them.""",Simple parallel circuit or a basic voltage divider.,1-2,Wide (+/- 15%),0-1. One obvious wrong-value resistor might be present.,None. 
3,Advanced,"""I need to combine a few concepts to find the solution.""",Requires an LC-filter for stabilization or a more complex multi-branch circuit.,2,Medium (+/- 10%),1-2. Decoy components are more tempting.,"May use one simple mutator (e.g., ""Overheat"")."
4,Hard,"""I need to find a single, specific, non-obvious solution.""",Complex mixed-signal paths requiring a precise understanding of all interactions.,"2-3, possibly with conflicting requirements.",Narrow (+/- 5%),"2-3. Includes different component types (e.g., a useless inductor).","Must use hybrid archetypes (e.g., Stabilizer + Timed Charge)."
5,Expert,"""I need to think outside the box and use all my system knowledge.""","Non-obvious solutions, possibly requiring ""components with character"" or ""black boxes"".",2-3 with conflicting requirements.,Critical (+/- 2%),"3+. The component kit is very ""noisy"" with decoys.",Uses complex hybrids and critical mutators that change the approach entirely.
